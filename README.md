# My Data Analytics Portfolio

## Intro

Greetings! Here is where you will find a portfolio of my work on data analysis, including Excel, Tableau, SQL, and Python.

These projects are sample projects from CareerFoundry. Some contain fictional datasets, while others use modified real-world data that is or has been publicly available.

## [GameCo video game sales](https://github.com/Nes112/GameCo)

With this Excel project, I looked at a dataset of video game sales from 1980 to 2016, and identified trends in sales within genres and geographic regions.

## [Flu risk assessment](https://github.com/Nes112/Flu-risk-assessment)

Using real data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, I looked at the flu risk in every state across the U.S. for each month out of the year. 

Using various indicators, I calculated a risk index for each state and month, and presented my results in a Tableau visualization.

## [Rockbuster SQL analysis](https://github.com/Nes112/Rockbuster-SQL-Project)

Using SQL to query a relational database of movie rental data, I answered business questions for a fictional company called Rockbuster.

My final report in the form of a Tableau presentation answers questions about some of Rockbuster's top customers.
 
## [Instacart customer analysis](https://github.com/Nes112/Instacart-analysis)

Using the data from the Instacart Customer Insights Dataset, 2017, I answered business questions about Instacart's customer base and spending habits.

I used Python's pandas library to manipulate and merge datasets, ending up with a dataframe of over 32 million rows. I used the matplotlib library to create visualizations, and used my final report to answer crucial business questions.
